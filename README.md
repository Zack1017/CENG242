# CENG242

## Lab 1 
The goal is to create the code from the slides eq1 and eq2, run them and create a test bench and wave form 

## Lab 2
The purpose of this lab is to become familiar with manipulating VHDL arrays (slices, concatenation, etc.), and the numeric_std library. Your task is to create a 4-bit adder/subtractor with carry-out and two’s-complement overflow
detection.

## Lab 3 
The objective of this lab is to develop a strong understanding of generics and the use of the generate statement in digital design. Specifically, this lab involves designing and implementing two key components:
- A generic two’s two-complement adder/subtractor circuit that includes carry-in, carry-out, and overflow detection.
Through this lab, you will apply these principles to build and test both designs successfully.
